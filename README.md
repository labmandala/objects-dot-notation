<h1>Objects Dot Notation</h1>
<p>Program object uses dot notation for properties, key-value pairs, and modifications to reveal messages.</p>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>After creation of an empty object, dot notation was used to add properties to it using key-value pairs. Next the properties were modified by changing the value of one property and removing an element from an array. Once debugged, hidden messages were revealed.</p>

<p>The code was then refactored to be more compact and readable. New properties, values and DOM elements were added, as well as conditional statements to change the body, text, and reveal a gif to celebrate meeting or surpassing the goals. </p>
