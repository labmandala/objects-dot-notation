<h1>Objects Dot Notation</h1>
<p>Program object uses dot notation for properties, key-value pairs, and modifications to reveal messages.</p>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>After creation of an empty object, dot notation was used to add properties to it using key-value pairs. Next the properties were modified by changing the value of one property and removing an element from an array. Finally, once debugged, hidden messages were revealed.</p>
